*In this Programming Assignment I have attempted the LINE TO LINE FIXING MODEL*. 

*To do this assigment, I have referred to many online tutorial for tensorflow and deep learning. Becasue of this there can be some resembles between my code and the official documents of tensorflow. Although I am atatching all the links which i used for this assignment. But I tried my utmost to understand what is deep learning and how it works by using this materials.*
